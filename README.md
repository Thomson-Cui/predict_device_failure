# Predict Device Failure

[Problem Description](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_cz06nPiN5CVk1qci1EQUhyM3JON0lROGVZWmJoelR2aHFV)

Challenge: "You are tasked with building a predictive model using machine learning to predict the
probability of a device failure. When building this model, be sure to minimize false positives and
false negatives. The column you are trying to predict is called failure with binary value 0 for
non-failure and 1 for failure."
